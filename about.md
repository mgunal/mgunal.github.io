title: About Me
---

I'm a curious technical guy interested in Computer Architecture, Computer Vision, Imaging, Machine learning, AR/VR and many other things.

I'm currently working as a Computer Vision Architect in Arm Cambridge. My goal is to ensure that Arm hardware and software tools perform well on computer vision workloads.
Previously I worked as a team lead in R-Class [CPU](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-cpu/cortex-r/cortex-r82)s
designed AR/VR Accelerator hardware for [Display Processor](https://www.arm.com/company/news/2019/05/making-virtual-more-of-a-reality)s, 
worked on several [ISP](https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-multimedia/image-signal-processor/mali-c71ae)s.


I'm always up to learn new things and I like to work on cutting edge technology projects.
I'm curious about how computer hardware works, how hardware and software talk to each other. Why our forefathers made certain design decisions and if they are still relevant to today's world. 
I frequently catch myself thinking about what can be the solution for the next-generation technological challenges. 

Thanks for reading!
